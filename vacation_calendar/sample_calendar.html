 * If you are paid biweekly, then in any given year, two (rarely three) months

 *
 * If you are paid bimonthly, then this array should be empty, because there
 * will be no three-check months
 *
 * This script does not currently support weekly accrual

 * For 2023, if you are paid on Fridays and the first paycheck of the year is
 * January 13, then the three-check months will be June and December

/*
 * Definition of all your time off (company holidays, vacation, sick leave,

 *
 * Each row is one day off.  Each field is an array of values:
 *
 * month       - Month of the PTO (1=January ... 12=December)
 * day         - Days of the PTO
 * PTO type    - The following codes are currently recognized (see also
 *               comments for the function generate_pto_database in
 *               calendar_generator.js)
 *                b  = Bereavement leave

 *                w  = Working day.  Used when a weekend (normally time off) is
 *                     a work day.  This sometimes happens in some countries
 *                     (e.g. in China)
 * Days        - The amount of time off taken.  Normally this will be 1 or a
 *               fraction.  Negative values and numbers greater than 1 may be
 *               used to apply corrections to the total counts for unusual
 *               circumstances that this scrips is not able to handle.  Zero
 *               may be used to add a description tool-tip to a work day or a
 *               weekend without affecting the total counts.
 * Description - A description of the time off.  Will appear in the generated
 *               calendar as a tool-tip.
